# TWINS FUNCTION IN PHP

During a test, I was faced with this problem of checking if two strings are twins. I couldn't finish the problem in time so I decided to write it as short as possible in php.

## Run the script

I use php 8.1 but the script work on php 7.

```bash
cd gitdirectory
```

## Usage

```bash
php twins.php
```
